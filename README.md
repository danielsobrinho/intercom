### A console for us front-end devs

Intercom is a JavaScript-based console I/O system designed for 
easy extension using a module system.

**R-R-R-REEDOOO. This is currently a dev branch for version 2 of intercom.**

Intercom v2 will be an *extremely* breaking change version which will embrace
the fantastic advances in javascript that have happened since inception. It will
also be bundled as a repo with a dummy server in node to serve intercom files.
